Use a GP
Use test data to validate the model
Lag times not necessary for monthly data
Use rainfall anomalies instead of raw data
Ignore leap days
Separate by season
Maybe include arctic oscillation and ENSO

Spatial GP model: we have an individual "residual" GP for each gridpoint that uses an RBF kernel over the time domain
(so that precipitation is a smoothly changing function of time). In addition, we use a learnable mean function.
For this mean function, we use another GP: an RBF kernel over the spatial domain.
This procedure we do twice, for summer and winter. OR: we model the seasonality, too.
For this, we learn a very simple function of the months with a broad, fixed lengthscale, to model the changing impact in summer/winter.

other idea: use a smoothly changing GP to model both spatial and seasonal effect: spatial matern kernel + 12 month periodic kernel over month input

simpler idea if we're not interested in predicting anyway, but rather evaluating the model on arbitrary points in between:
use a GP with Matern52(time) and add a linear mean which can depend on the month (for every month, we have a different linear coefficient).
